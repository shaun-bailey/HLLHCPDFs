\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The high-luminosity (HL) upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
will operate between 2026 and 2037, extending by more than ten years
the LHC lifetime as compared to Runs II and III.
%
Thanks to extensive improvements both in the accelerator chain and
in the detectors, the HL-LHC aims to accumulate a total
integrated luminosity of around $\mathcal{L}=3$ ab$^{-1}$.
%
This large luminosity will make possible a number of important
physics analysis from the measurement of the couplings
of the Higgs boson to the second generation quarks and leptons
to that of its self-coupling.

In order to fully exploit the physics potential of the HL-LHC,
it is of paramount importance to be able to reduce as much as possible]the
  various sources of uncertainties affecting the theoretical calculations.
  %
  One of the most relevant ones is the theoretical uncertainty
  associated to our imperfect knowledge of the quark
  and gluon structure of the proton, encapsulated
  by the parton distribution functions.
