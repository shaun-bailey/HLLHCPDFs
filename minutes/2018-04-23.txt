  PDF studies at the HL-LHC
  Meeting 2018/04/23
**********************************

* Agreed to generate all applgrids at 14 TeV, which is the center of
mass energy used for the Yellow Report studies

* Agreed to put in the github repo the MCFM input cards used to
generate the applgrids for the different processes, to make sure that
we all use common settings

* ttbar => applgrids generated at NLO using MCFM
Using a fine binning, can be changed later if needed

* We might also want to look at double differential distributions
in the case of top quark pair production. Katerina will provide some preliminary
binning to use in our studies.

* The value of the top quark mass used is 173.2 GeV, but this should not
affect the fit results since we are using pseudo-data

* High mass Drell-Yan => Grids available for 8 TeV and 13 TeV,
will not be recomputed for 14 TeV
The applgrids correspond to the double differential distributions
in Mll and yll. Other distributions are less relevant in this context
(ie the Delta y_ll distribution was originally used for photon PDF studies)

* We agreed to produce for each process a bunch of validation plots, showing
the kinematical coverage of the pseudo-data that we have produced and
the expected statistical uncertainty per bin.

* When producing cross-section plots (and PDF uncertainty plots)
we will use the PDF4LHC15 NNLO set/

* Z pT => Set up is ready to produce applgrids at 14 TeV but
there are still some technical issues to be overcome in the next days

* Concerning the systematic errors, Katerina will investigate within CMS
how existing measurements can be extrapolated to the HL-LHC. We will also
need to hear from ATLAS and LHCb.

* In order to estimate the impact of the HL-LHC pseudo-data we will use Hessian profiling
applied to the PDF4LHC15 NNLO set.

* This can be achieved for example using the ePump package, which is basically
a Hessian profiling method with different choices of chi2 tolerance possible.

* At the end of the day we really want to carry out a full fit
(or three of them, to be more precise, and then combine them a la PDF4LHC), since
approximate methods like profiling/reweighting might fail once we add a lot
of different experiments.

* But to bencharmk the addition of individual processes and to understand
their impact on the PDFs, the use of profiling is reasonable
